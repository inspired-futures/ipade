# ìpàdé
ìpàdé (Yoruba word for Meeting) is a web-serverless version of [Openfire Pàdé](https://github.com/igniterealtime/openfire-pade-plugin) hosted on GitPages

ìpàdé uses static web pages hosted here on Github to run a custom version of jitsi-meet. It works with both Jitsi-Meet and Openfire Pàdé hosted instances, but defaults to the Openfire server at pade.chat.

## Demo
Open a browser window/tabs instances and point it at https://inspired-futures.github.io/ipade/index.html?room=AnyRoomNameYouLike

## Installation
Nothing to install!. It is is serverless. Just clone this GitHub repository and enabled GitPages for the docs folder. 

## How to use
First edit config.js and interface_config.js directly from GitHub. Modify as required.
